# Cover Card jekyll theme

Create a cover page for your social media profiles, host it for free on Github Pages, and maintain it in minutes, not hours. [Demo](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card)

This theme is ideal for people or organizations who are busy enjoying their life or business and who want a simple business card for their online presence.

Please keep this README file because it contains the credits at the end and it might become handy after you have completely forgoten the set-up instructions.

## Design rationale

The design rationale of this theme is to do less than other themes: "Less is more"

The majority (99%) of the availabe jekyll themes offers a blog, but I have never been able to keep blog content (or its technology) updated over time.

Let's be honest with ourselves: How does an (abandoned) blog centered web site looks to new visitors if we have not posted since two years ago?

## Make it yours

[Fork this repository](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card/fork) and edit the files to your liking: As a first step, you may want to replace the images and edit the `_config.yml` with your online profiles. You can test the result almost in real-time at the Github Pages url displayed in the Settings tab.

### Avatar or Logo

The avatar image should be square and at least 200 pixels. Chances are that you have a selfie somewhere in your media storage.

### Background image sets the mood

There is no aspect ratio requirement for the background image, but it should be big enough for contemporary (desktop, tablet, phone) computer displays and dark enough in order to work for the white foreground text and icons.

### Advanced options

You can find advanced options (CNAME, custom social icons, styles) for this theme in the documentation (readme) at the [master branch](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card/tree/master).
